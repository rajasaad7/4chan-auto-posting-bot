Random Name,Example Options,"PRQ is getting listed on binance and/or huobi very soon, possibly this week. Why? Because in the Chinese AMA a couple weeks ago, Anatoly presented this whiteboard, which shows PRQ interfacing with the logos of 4 exchanges: CoinMetro (already listed), Okex (listed last month), Huobi, and Binance. 
Secondly, the following wallet received 2M PRQ from the PRQ TEAM wallet a week ago. 

The day of the Okex listing, it sent 250k PRQ to Okex just before the announcement. Another 150k were sent to other wallets, however 1.6M PRQ are still sitting there, and are probably waiting to be sent to binance and/or huobi.

It?s coming. By while it?s still cheap.
